This project was developed as a web-based system for day hospitals to manage electronic prescriptions (e-prescribing) and streamline medication management. The system allows nurses, surgeons, and pharmacists to handle patient admissions, prescriptions, and medication dispensing efficiently.

Key Features & Users:
Admin – Manages hospital, medical staff, ward, theatre, diagnosis, medication, and interaction records.
Nurse – Captures patient details, vitals, allergies, and medical history, administers medication, and records patient discharge.
Surgeon – Books surgeries, prescribes medication, and receives alerts for contraindications (allergies, interactions, and medical conditions).
Pharmacist – Dispenses prescriptions, prioritizes urgent requests, manages stock levels, and rejects prescriptions if necessary.
All users log in securely, and the system ensures real-time tracking of prescribed, dispensed, and administered medication.

My Role in the Project:
This was a group project, and I was in charge of coding the surgeon-related functionalities. My work included:

Implementing the surgery booking system (capturing surgeon, patient, date, session, and theatre).
Developing the prescription module, ensuring surgeons could add medication while the system automatically checked for contra-indications, allergies, and interactions.
Implementing an alert system that notifies surgeons of potential medication risks, requiring a justification if overridden.
Ensuring surgeons could view prescription statuses and respond to pharmacist feedback.
This project demonstrated my ability to work in a team while handling complex database interactions, validation logic, and user interface development for medical professionals
